<p><em>“In cooking school, they used to tell us that you could tell 
    everything about a cook based on their roast chicken, so I became a bit obsessive. 
    And you are going to benefit from that.”</em> – Love Quinn, You.</p>

    <p><em>"At least once a year I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili. 
        The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know eachother in the pot. 
        I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before, pressing garlic, and dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own ancho chiles. 
        It's a recipe passed down from Malones for generations - it's probably the thing I do best." </em> - Kevin Mallone, The Office </p>
